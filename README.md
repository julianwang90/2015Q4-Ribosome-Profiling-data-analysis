Analysis of illumina NextSeq-500 sequencing data, formed of Ribosome Protected Fragments (RPF) samples
and Whole Transcriptome (WT) samples, with a total of 12 samples for each (from 3 biological replicates and 4 conditions).

## Preprocessing
### Processing raw sequencing reads
### Trim adapters
### Remove contaminated reads using bowtie
### Map reads to reference genome using tophat

## Analysis
### Translatome analysis with babel
### Transcriptome analysis with DESeq2
